# Data Collection (Oct. 2024 - Nov. 2024)
### 1. Literature Review & NCBI
Based on the literature review, marine bacteria were listed up on excel file with the corresponded enzyme sequences from NCBI.  
By using the InterPro (InterPro 104.0), predict the presence and location of signal peptides, which is a short sequence of AA at the beginning of protein. If it is located in the extracellular region, it indicates that the enzyme will be secreted from the cell to function in the outside, which means the extracellular localization allows the enzymes to act on substrates in the environment around the cell.
  1. Copy paste of the protein sequence to the box 'Search by sequence'
  2. Press search
  3. From the result, it is possible to finds the conserved domains and signal peptides in the protein sequence.

From NCBI, checked the gene sequences to see if the listed bacteria contain any additional enzymes besides the one mentioned in each paper during literature review.

### 2. BLASTp
Identify protein sequences with the high identity of sequence to those in the listed bacteria.

The result shows how similar a given protein sequence (query) is to other protein sequences in a database. It describe which proteins in a database are most similar to your query. 
For each row of sequence from bacteria, you can find E-value (for significance), Identity (for similarity), and the alignment (to understand how they match).

The high matched results were recorded on excel file together with collected data from NCBI previously.

### 3. BacDive
It confirm if the bacteria with available type strains also contain the proteins identified in the BLAST results.  
It also provide properties of specific bacteria (habitat, growth T, pathogenicity).
